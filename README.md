## Build

This is a first version of my personal site made using a template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) and images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). The color scheming is based on the [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) theme, and the site is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Deploying A Clone

To launch a clone of this website build:

1. Make a fork of this repository
2. Change the name of the repository from gmross.github.io to \<your-username>.github.io
3. Go to Settings>Environment and make sure github-pages is there
4. View the deployment to see how it looks. Note that it may take 10-15 minutes to first appear after creating the repository
